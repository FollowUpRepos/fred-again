1. Fred again

# What was my motivation.?

- When Covid-19 start i had depression and i was lost. Then i discovered this artist with the name Fred Again. Where from his songs you could feel that he was talking about your feelings and always he had a way to cheer you up. So for me this artist it means a lot !

## Why did i build this project?

- I did this project because i was feeling motivated to make a research about someone that i really respect. 2 months before when i saw that he will have a concert on Berlin i checked his website and it was a bit messy and i thought if i could help me with the same way he helped me?

### What problem does it solve?

- It doesnt really solving any problem, but its easier for the user to have a basic knowledge about this person where to find tickets and his social media.

#### What makes my project stand out?

- It is a simple website for people who want to check about this music producer and find informations about him. There is as well a form where you contact him for any sponsor activities or partnership.

- In general my project is a website for a music artist/producer. It is responsive with basic HTML 5 and Css. There are some links and forms for the people who want to know more and contact his team. !

2. Email to Fred

- Hello Fred again, my name is Kyriakos Vangeltzikis based in Berlin and i am student at the DCI (Web Development college).You helped me a lot with your music the last years and you saved me from depression and you were there for me with your music when i didnt had friends. I decided to make a website for you. I want to inform you that i didnt publish anything yet because first i had to to ask your permision to publish it first on git hib (is a website that us as a students we are publishing our projects) and of course is not the official website or trying to sabotage you. You can have a look as well and if you like it let me know. You are the only reason i am using spotify to listening your music without ads and interuptions. I tried to book a ticket to come on your concert at Mercedes-Benz 12-09-2023(Berlin-Germany) but the moment the online tickets went online they went sold out after 5 mins.
